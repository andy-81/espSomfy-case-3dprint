# espSomfy-case-3dprint
3d designed printable case for the espsomfy setup

I went through many iterations of case before ending up with this one. 

I started with a much smaller compact version which had the C1101 board on top of the esp32 board, the problem I had was the esp32 board then cause interference when I put it into the case. This led me to eventually putting the two boards side by side and adding the hole on the front of the case to reduce interference and make the espSomfy function well across the whole house.
